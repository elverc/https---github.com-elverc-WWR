            <h1><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h1>
            <h2>Is rafting dangerous?</h2>
            <p>
            Rafting is thrilling, exciting, wet, wild, and unbelievably fun. However, as with all adventure sports, there is inherent and assumed risk involved. Risk contributes to the excitement, and is one of the reasons people enjoy rafting at all levels. The guides working for us are trained to minimize and manage risks, and statistically speaking, you’re safer in a raft than in your car.
            A very important aspect in any emergency is the ability to self rescue; please take this into account when reserving your rafting adventure.  Our adventure specialists are available to help you pick the best possible adventure for your experience and abilities. Please do not hesitate to ask any and all questions concerning what may be the best trip for you and your party.</p>
            <h3>Do we need reservations? </h3>
            <p>
                While we do take walk-ins and last minute reservations, we strongly suggest that you book your trip as far in advance as possible. Our trips fill up quickly, especially during the peak rafting season of Memorial Day through Labor Day. Some trips we offer are by reservation only, please do not hesitate to contact us with any reservation questions.</p>
            <h4>If I can’t swim can I still go rafting?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears a coast guard approved ‘life vest’ or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non-swimmers go on rafting trips, and they have a great time. Your guides will give you an in depth and engaging river orientation talk before your trip explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event you fall out of the raft. Our reservation specialists are trained to place you on a trip that suits your party’s abilities and concerns. Guides are trained in swiftwater rescue and will work with the rest of your guide team to ensure that you feel comfortable with the whitewater conditions on your trip. All non-swimming folks should inform their guide on the trip.

            <h4>Lastly, What to expect:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Your trip begins when you meet us at our office at check-in time. We collect any necessary release forms and distribute  gear. Then everyone gets geared up.  The trip leader will assign you a guide, and your guide will deliver a safety talk  – a vital twenty minute discussion about how to be safe on the water.  We will then load on the bus which will transport you to the “put in.” At the put-in we move quickly to get out on the river. You’ll help carry rafts (many hands make light work). Once the rafts are on the river, so are you. You’ll receive a paddle talk, learn to paddle as a team, and be rafting before you know it. Then you’ll head on down the river, learn a little, enjoy the scenery, and hopefully, see some wildlife.
